											<h3><strong>Acoustic Guitars</strong></h3>
										</header>
										<p>I taught myself the acoustic guitar in high school, which naturally led to countless hours of playing with other musicians for friends and family. I really enjoyed serving as a guitar tutor for <a href = "https://www.umsevenmile.org/">Seven Mile</a> from 2019 to 2023 as I was able to share my passion for music with talented young students in Detroit.</p>

											<h3><strong>Community Involvement</strong></h3>

										<p>In addition to tutoring guitar, I served as the Director of Music at  <a href = "https://www.umsevenmile.org/">Seven Mile</a>, where I assisted with administrative initiatives in partnership with local communities. My responsibilities included coordinating tutor and student attendance across various locations, scheduling public musical showcases at the end of each term, and managing financial expenditures.</p>
