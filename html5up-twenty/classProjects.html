										<h2><b>Adaptive Cruise Control Embedded System &#8226; Winter 2022</b></h2>
                                        <p> For our final project in EECS 461: Embedded Control Systems, we were tasked with building an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) car system on Simulink with auto-steering and an automatic cycling between these three modes:<br>
											<ul>
												<li>Manual: the speed and path of the car are controlled using a potentiometer on the control board and the haptic wheel respectively. </li>
												<li>Velocity: specifies the car’s traveling velocity using dip switches on the microcontroller.</li>
												<li>Position: This occurs when there is a lead car within a certain preset distance of our car and traveling slower than our car, causing our car to match the speed of the lead car.</li>
											</ul>
											Our system was entirely built on Simulink using overhead scaffolding built by the course instructors. We built the Simulink model into C code that could be run in an NXP workspace and then implemented on a Driving Simulator provided by the course. The hardware connections to the computer entailed an S32K144 microcontroller, a motherboard with a potentiometer and dip switches, and a haptic wheel. We produced C code that reads and writes to registers on the aforementioned hardware to develop various haptic capabilities throughout the semester. The ACC final project built upon concepts and work that we previously completed while designing our own flow logic, controllers, and vehicle dynamics to follow complex systems of differential equations.

											<h2><b>Digital Signal Processing Optical Character Recognition &#8226; Winter 2022</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>I worked on a 5-person student project team enrolled in EECS 351: Digital Signal Processing to develop an algorithm that allows a user to input a screenshot of a lecture board, and output a nicely formatted LaTeX document of those notes in return. Our program architecture consisted of four subsystems:
											<ol>
												<li>Image processing and filtering of the lecture recording screenshot.	</li>
												<li>Isolating each individual character.</li>
												<li>Classifying each individual character.</li>
												<li>Outputting that classified character to a LaTeX document.</li>
											</ol>
											My individual contributions to the team was in leading our group’s Character Classification subsystem with the sklearn classification library in Python, the LaTeX Document Formatting in MATLAB, scheduling subsystem deadlines, and documenting most of the content on our project’s <a href="https://github.com/EmiliaPsacharopoulos/HandwritingToLatex">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/eecs-351-handwriting-to-latex/home?authuser=0">website</a>.

										<h2><b>Probabilistic Roadmap Path Planning Study &#8226; Winter 2022 </b></h2> 
										<p>In MATH 462: Mathematical Modeling, my project partner and I decided to research the
											efficiency of an autonomous bicycle robotic model in Simulink. We explored the existing model’s control system, vehicle dynamics, and robustness of the Probabilistic Roadmap path planning algorithm in detail. Additionally, we extended our study to develop our own model of the vehicle dynamics using continuous time integration, and compared it against their discrete time integration technique. This <a href="MATH_pathPlanningProject.pdf">research paper</a> details our findings.</p>

											<h2><b>Algorithmic Software Design &#8226; Winter 2022</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>EECS 281: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms is the predominant introductory course for computer scientists to master the balance of space and time tradeoffs in algorithmic implementations at the University of Michigan. Out of all material covered in this course, designing our own simplified version of Structured Query Language (SQL) was by far the most difficult. The “SillyQL” project rigorously tested my knowledge of interacting with various data structures and hash tables to quickly parse enormous datasets for any desired information. </p>

											<h2><b>AM Superheterodyne Radio Receiver &#8226; Winter 2020</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>In EECS 216: Introduction to Signals and Systems, I assembled the back-end of a working superheterodyne AM radio using resistors, capacitors, op-amps, diodes, and an audio speaker. The process included constructing a bandpass filter to only pass a desired range of frequencies, an envelope detector to demodulate the signal, an output amplifier to boost the signal, and connecting everything in series to the output speaker. Finally, I tested my radio by tuning my local oscillator frequency to isolate one broadcast station at a time. </p>
